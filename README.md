# Feedback From Assessment 2
Below was the feedback i received for the Web App Pitch 
"Your background research was excellent, and thorough, the insights you found were good and made sense, but it could have been better identify things that would practically inform your design and how, you could also find some extra marks by comparing some existing study tools and looking at what about their design does or doesn’t work for your target group. Your user personas were good, thorough and well put together, they offer you lots of specific requirements to reposed to in your design. Well done. Your design iteration was ok, you didn’t explain why you changed the things you did between sketches and the mockup. You described a lot of decisions you made and what they do, but you did not really address how these design decisions were motivated by the specific needs that you outlined in your user personas, or specific things you found in your background research - you did write a lot of background reach and interviews - you need to tell us how that informed your design. Your functional specifications table was thorough and logical. Your development roadmap was ok, but importantly you did not include any periods of testing which you will need to plan for."

As the team wanted me to iterate on my designs, i showed my prototypes to a couple of my peers and friends to ask for their opinions and according to this feedback, i made a few changes to my design for StudBud. 

# Main Feedback from Peers
When my peers had a look at my A2 Web App Pitch, they found it interesting, As they hadn't come across a virtual study tool in comparison to Kanban boards which they were familiar with through Trello, Notion, Monday.com and other competitors. As a result, they were mainly interested in what the study tool/sessions would offer. They liked the idea of having calm videos such as rain falling in the background and said it gave them the Low-Fi Study Music Playlist 

. As a result,they also recommended me to rethink the navigation bar and how i wanted my users to interact with the the navigation. They also liked how i had about us and contact us, but suggested combining some of these pages so that there information would be more readily available in one place rather than multiple pages. This was a double edged sword as having multiple pages allowed information to be more digestible and concise while making it bothersome for the user to constantly change their page to look for different information.

On the other hand having less pages and combining parts of the pages together would allow users to access information much easier and be less bothersome but then that would result in a more clunkier and less digestible design to view content and text. 

This was definitely a challenge that i had to overcome and after much consideration I made a few changes.

# Changes to Design
* __Add in an option for people to go Home __
* __Switch the Position of Dashboard otherwise known as Kanban or Task Board with Study Session, as many students i interviewed liked the idea of a virtual Study session as there are many Kanban boards available online.__
* __Simplify the Dashboard.__


# A3 --> A5 Changes
This was how my A3 looked like. In comparison to this prototype. The New Version only has 3 components in the Nav Bar, which include Home where it has a brief overview of the charity & its music programs, the abouts page where it has more about the charity and more links to contact the charity and finally the sponsor page where users can see how see how sponsoring can help the charity. It also has a newsletter link that users can input to be part of the monthly newsletter for the charity patrons and general audience.

Key Changes
  * __Nav Bar__, The Nav Bar was reduced to 3 options (Home, About & Sponsor Page)
  * __Changes in Pages__, As a result of the Nav Bar changing the events & programs page was embedded into the new 3 pages. The events and its information were redirected to the Charities Social media platforms which were linked at the bottom of each page so that visitors can keep track of the charity events. The contacts page also disappeared and was also embedded into all the Home, About Us and Sponsor Us page so that users regardless of whether they want to join a musical program or sponsor can contact the charity easily.
  * __Removal of unessential features__, To keep the website simple, the content on the programs page was simplified where overview of the program was provided on the home page and similarly to the contacts option, visitors could choose the instruments they wanted to learn more about and contact the charity in the form of an expression of interest.

# Design Style
In terms of the design style, i opted for a top - down method where information was given to the users from the top till down. I used a colour palette between a blue, grey and white so that.

In terms of the delivery of information I've kept it fairly simple by headers (h1-3) and using text formatting to emphasise certain words or titles to draw make the text and content more engaging for the audience to read through.
