Below was the feedback i received for the Web App Pitch 
"Your background research was excellent, and thorough, the insights you found were good and made sense, but it could have been better identify things that would practically inform your design and how, you could also find some extra marks by comparing some existing study tools and looking at what about their design does or doesn’t work for your target group. Your user personas were good, thorough and well put together, they offer you lots of specific requirements to reposed to in your design. Well done. Your design iteration was ok, you didn’t explain why you changed the things you did between sketches and the mockup. You described a lot of decisions you made and what they do, but you did not really address how these design decisions were motivated by the specific needs that you outlined in your user personas, or specific things you found din your background research - you did write a lot of background reach and interviews - you need to tell us how that informed your design. Your functional specifications table was thorough and logical. Your development roadmap was ok, but importantly you did not include any periods of testing which you will need to plan for."
