# Feedback From Assessment 2
Below was the feedback i received for the Web App Pitch 
"Your background research was excellent, and thorough, the insights you found were good and made sense, but it could have been better identify things that would practically inform your design and how, you could also find some extra marks by comparing some existing study tools and looking at what about their design does or doesn’t work for your target group. Your user personas were good, thorough and well put together, they offer you lots of specific requirements to reposed to in your design. Well done. Your design iteration was ok, you didn’t explain why you changed the things you did between sketches and the mockup. You described a lot of decisions you made and what they do, but you did not really address how these design decisions were motivated by the specific needs that you outlined in your user personas, or specific things you found in your background research - you did write a lot of background reach and interviews - you need to tell us how that informed your design. Your functional specifications table was thorough and logical. Your development roadmap was ok, but importantly you did not include any periods of testing which you will need to plan for."

As the team wanted me to iterate on my designs, i showed my prototypes to a couple of my peers and friends to ask for their opinions and according to this feedback, i made a few changes to my design for StudBud. 

# Main Feedback from Peers
When my peers had a look at my A2 Web App Pitch, they found it interesting, As they hadn't come across a virtual study tool in comparison to Kanban boards which they were familiar with through Trello, Notion, Monday.com and other competitors. As a result, they were mainly interested in what the study tool/sessions would offer. They liked the idea of having calm videos such as rain falling in the background and said it gave them the Low-Fi Study Music Playlist 

. As a result,they also recommended me to rethink the navigation bar and how i wanted my users to interact with the the navigation. They also liked how i had about us and contact us, but suggested combining some of these pages so that there information would be more readily available in one place rather than multiple pages. This was a double edged sword as having multiple pages allowed information to be more digestible and concise while making it bothersome for the user to constantly change their page to look for different information.

On the other hand having less pages and combining parts of the pages together would allow users to access information much easier and be less bothersome but then that would result in a more clunkier and less digestible design to view content and text. 

This was definitely a challenge that i had to overcome and after much consideration I made a few changes.

# Changes to Design
* __Add in an option for people to go Home __
* __Switch the Position of Dashboard otherwise known as Kanban or Task Board with Study Session, as many students i interviewed liked the idea of a virtual Study session as there are many Kanban boards available online __
* __Simplify the Dashboard __
* __ Make the Dictionary & Pomodoro Timer, bigger buttons so they're easy to track.


# A2 --> A3 Final Changes

  * __Home Page__, With the addition of it provides subtle onboarding to StudBud and the key features StudBud provides to its users. 
  * __Changes in Pages__, 
  - The Dashboard has changed to something really simple with just a task managemer/Kanban Board. 
  - The Study Session doesn't include a video anymore in the background. Having too many moving compartments (Timer + Video + Dictionary) might be too much for the user to comprehend so the background was kept simple and consistent with a white background.
  - Home Page has a quick introduction and pictures to guide users to what the purpose of the features are.
  * __Removal of unessential features__,
  - While the proposal included Study tools such as a Goal Setter, i decided to leave this out as visually the 3 main features Music Player, Dictionary & Pomodoro Timer looked more simple centred in the page.

# Design Style
In terms of the design style, i opted for a top - down method where information was given to the users from the top till down. I used a simple colour palette of Light Blue and White with Green for contrast.

While i did test a nav bar on the top, i found that having the nav bar on the side looked more natural than having the nav bar on the top.

# Areas for Improvement/Development

1. Nav bar
- Instead of just a word, this nav bar can be further developed with interactive buttons that hover between coloured (Blue) and white that change when a user hovers over the button.

2. Dashboard
- With further development, the tasklist can include colours based on priority so that users can distinguish between high priority and low priority tasks better instead of relying on just the words "Low" & "High priority".

3. Home Page
- Videos/Tutorials of how to use features of StudBud would benefit users with being able to use StudBud better and also give the Home page more purpose than just outlining key features and onboarding.
- Linking the Features to the pages would also help usability of the StudBud program.

4. Study Session
- To further eliminate distractions when studying, allowing an option to minimise the key features (Music Player, Dictionary and Timer) can help users remain more focused.
- Timer --> Add music/sounds to when the timer ends for better user feedback.
